  - What is this?
    - These are some scripts and Dockerfiles for building emacs as a service, running in containers, accessible via a browser or a VNC client
    - We actually run a container and run X11, so really any Linux application would work through this with minimal modification

  - Why?
    - I don't really know

  - How?
    - Clone this repo.
    - ~./build.sh~
    - ~./maracas.sh~
    - Visit ~localhost:8080/guacamole~ in the browser or ~localhost:5900~ with a VNC viewer (e.g. Remmina)
  - Cleanup?
    - ~./clean.sh~
