  - What is this?
    - These are some scripts and Dockerfiles for building emacs as a service, running in containers, accessible via a browser or a VNC client
    - We actually run a container and run X11, so really any Linux application would work through this with minimal modification
    - Building, running, and viewing in the browser looks something like this:

  - Why?
    - I don't really know

  - How?
    - Clone this repo.
    - ~./maracas run~ if you are satisfied with the "stable" dockerhub images
    - ~./maracas build~ to build a customized or unstable version
    - ~./maracas stop~ to destroy the environment when you're done
    - Visit ~http://localhost:8080/guacamole~ in the browser or ~localhost:5900~ with a VNC viewer (e.g. Remmina)

  - Cleanup?
    - ~./clean.sh~
